        <strong>Name: </strong>Dorothy Ibia<br>
        <strong>Alt School ID: </strong>ALT/SOE/024/5047<br>
        <strong>Learning Track: </strong>School of Engineering
        <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
        <p>I am a Medical Device V&V Engineer with a background in Mechanical and Biomechanical Engineering. I like to describe myself as the bridge between science and arts because I am just as much of an artist as I am a scientist. My interests vary from time to time, but currently, I'm hung up on musicals, theology and medical TV dramas. I love to sing, in fact, I'd say I'm pretty good at it. I also love to read and write poetry. If you had followed me on Twitter between 2016 and 2020, you'd have seen some of my poetry. In addition to V&V Engineer, I am also Software QA and Test Engineer. I know at this point you may be wondering, "who exactly is Dorothy? Is she a biomechanical engineer, a Software Qa Engineer, a poet or even a singer?" There's just one answer to that question - she is everything. Dorothy is the one that does it all.</p>
