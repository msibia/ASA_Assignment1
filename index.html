        <h2>Personal Details</h2>
        <strong>Name: </strong>Dorothy Ibia<br>
        <strong>Alt School ID: </strong>ALT/SOE/024/5047<br>
        <strong>Learning Track: </strong>School of Engineering
        <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
        <p>
            I am a medical device design verification Engineer with a background in Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering. I like to
            describe myself as the bridge between science and arts, because I am just as much an artist as I am a
            scientist. My interests vary from time to time, but currently, I'm hung up on musicals, theology and medical
            TV dramas. I love to sing, in fact, I'd say I'm pretty good at it. I also love to read and write poetry. If
            you had followed me on Twitter between 2016 and 2020, you'd have seen some of my poetry. I know at this point you may be wondering,
            "who exactly is Dorothy? Is she a biomechanical engineer, a design verification engineer, or a poet? Well, there's ust one answer to that question - she is everything. Dorothy is the one that does it all.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Alt School?</h2>
        <p>
            As a medical device design verification engineer, I am proficient in hardware testing. However, seeing as most modern medical devices are controlled by software, I realised that there was a gap in my knowledge. In order to effectively develop and verify medical devices, I have to understand and be able to develop the software that controls them.

        <h2>My Goals for the Next Year with AltSchool</h2> 
        <ul>
            <li>To understand the fundamentals of software development</li>
        </ul>
